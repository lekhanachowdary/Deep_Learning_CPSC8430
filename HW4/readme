This folder contains three files: DCGAN, WGAN, and a comparison plot file. 
The dataset used is the CIFAR 10 dataset, which can be downloaded from the following link: 
CIFAR 10 Dataset--> https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
Please download it to run the files. 

The DCGAN and WGAN models were too large to include directly in this repository. Please download them using the following links:
